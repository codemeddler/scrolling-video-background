# Scrolling Video Background

A test for using a video as a background image and animating it based on page scrolling.

## Notes

Plays a background video element as the page is scrolled.

+ Assumes 25FPS framerate.
+ Takes quite a bit of work on the video to not have a jarring effect; abstract bubbles from a soft drink worked best,
  but the logo isn't too shabby either'.
+ Only tested on Safari (WebKit)

## What is included

+ Javascript for the effect
+ CSS to showcase example styling
+ HTML to showcase example layout
